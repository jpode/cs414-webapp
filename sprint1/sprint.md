# Sprint 1 - T09 - OVER NINE THOUSAND!?

## Goal

## A team effort to build a simple web application!

## Definition of Done

* Ready for demo / customer release.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed.
* Product Increment release `v1.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the template, and a zip of the repo.

## Policies

* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.


## Metrics 

## Plan

Epics planned for this release.

* #1 README.md
* #2 team/eName.md
* #3 Resume
* #4 Distance Application

## Daily Scrums

## Review

#### Completed user stories (epics) in Sprint Backlog 
* *README.md*
* *Resume*
* *team/eName.md*
* *Distance Application*

#### Incomplete user stories / epics in Sprint Backlog 
* *None*
#### What went well
* Individual completion of assigned tasks
* Collaboration between all team members to solve issues as they arose
* Communication within the team about missing or incorrect elements of other members code

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* Flaws in our initial vision of how the project should be designed: Initally we had UI as an entirely separate class, and when we learned that would
	not work we were still able to put UI design into working code and have it function
* Imbalance of initally assigned work: We didn't know at the start how difficult any pieces of the work we portioned out would be, and some of it was 
	more difficult and time consuming. However, we only portioned out the actual programming parts of the assignment, and team members who had been
	assigned less programming took on more of the scrum leader type work. 

## Retrospective

Topic | Teamwork | Process | Tools
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
What we will change this time |  |  | 
What we did well |Communicating technical issues with other team members.  |  | Learning a relatively new language and implementing it in a short time span.
What we need to work on | Ensuring all team members have an understanding of how separately written code is interacting or intended to interact together.|  | Testing and other nuances of web based programming.
What we will change next time | | Increased communication about what the goals of the project are; ensuring all team members are on the same page as to what is going to be released and the process by which that will be achieved. Will be easier with ZenHub.  | Implement code standards to allow easier and quicker understanding of all code being written during the sprint .
