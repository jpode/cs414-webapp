# Teamwork Questionnaire for Jake Marrapode

1. __What is your personality type?__
   ISTP
1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   Text is best (630-251-3417), slack is second best, email is third. Any hours, I'll usually respond pretty quickly (under half an hour)
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   Getting all releases out on time and avoiding finishing work last-minute.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   Creating a plan of work allocation for everyone in the group before any work is started to ensure the sprints are 
   organized and no two people accidentally work on the same part of the project or a part of the project is missed.
   Keeping up communication over slack/text during this process will be essential to knowing what is done and what still
   needs to be finished.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   Commitments outside of class conflicting with deadlines, difficulty portioning out equal workloads amongst the team and allocating
   unexpected additional work needed throughout sprints.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   Communicating this to the rest of the team and making sure we all understand what every group member is expecting
   is vital. From there those who want to get a higher grade are welcome to put in the extra effort to achieve that.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   Yes, but this should be communicated from the start of each sprint. If there is anyone who wants to put in more effort
   it should be allocated from the beginning, so that they don't take up the work of others without them knowing. Getting an
   A at the cost of someone else's grade is not acceptable.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   I don't enough about the process and tools we're using to know, but I would guess somewhere in the range of 5-10 hours a week.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   A group meeting at the start of every sprint devoted to deciding who is allocated what work based on 
   preferences and skill sets is my suggestion.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   Preferably that person will communicate beforehand that they will have trouble meeting the deadline. Regardless, workload likely
   needs to be adjusted to compensate and i would expect anyone who doesn't follow through on commitments and doesnt communicate 
   beforehand to recieve a lower grade.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   Establish a standard of quality that should be enforced for all code for all projects. If someone still wants a higher quality of 
   work than the rest of the team is willing to commit to then they have the opportunity to do it themselves. 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   Communicate and understand. Everyone has a different scenario and life events so nobody will be consistent with when they get things 
   done. Understanding this and communicating when it becomes frustrating is key. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   Yes, probably once a week. I'm open to the time being adjusted if necessary though.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   Minimum once a week, likely more than that when we start getting into assignments and lots of collaboration is needed.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   Depends on the decision, major project modifications and releases will need everyones approval but small 20-30 line changes 
   only need approval of one or two members.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   Try to resolve th issue first and if it can't be resolved through communication, then go with the group majority
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   Create a standard of how the team process will work in the beginning of the sprint. If that isn't upheld then bring up the issue with 
   the entire team.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   Let everyone else know and see if the responsibilities can be more evenly distributed.
