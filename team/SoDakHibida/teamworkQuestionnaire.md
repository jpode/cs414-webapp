# Teamwork Questionnaire for Jacob Servaty

1. __What is your personality type?__
   * ESFJ
1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text is probably the easiest, (605)569-0241, though Email and Slack will work. Any hours will work, but it could take me an hour to response at any given time.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * My expectations are that we knock this TripCo project out of the water, learn a ton, and have a lot of fun doing it.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I would say that I struggle with teamwork. It's too easy to either be a control freak, or follow blindly. I want to learn how to find that happy medium.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Time Management is going to be our biggest opstacle. I have a large courseload, and as a group if we stay organized and consist, we'll kill it.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * Compromise and friendly discussion! Ro-Sham-Bo? We'd need to come to a conlusion before advancing on this project.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * 100% yes. You can't expect to split the work exactly eveningly into 4 ways, but getting an A doesn't result in another teammate getting an F. Plenty of work to go around. 
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * Professor Matthews said between 6-9 hours, but a few more hours wouldn't hurt.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We will need to discuss as a team, but if people are better at certain things, or if someone really wants a certain part, then it's all them.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * The biggest thing is communication. If someone is falling behind, then we, as teammates, could pick up the slack, but only if we know. Otherwise, with zero communication and they fall through, I'll have to throw them under the bus to Dave.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * This could be the most difficult thing to handle in a team... The team will need to agree on a standard initially.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * We don't need to be working at the exact same time, but again setting a standard of each person contributing a certain amount of work hours a week.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes. At least one a week.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Once a week will probably suffice. We have digital hangouts if more is needed.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * For major ones yes, but once we split into chunks then it's discretionary of the person on if they want/need to include the others.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * That person is outvoted... They at least warrant a discussion about the topic to sell their case, but if no else is swayed then we go with the majority.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * At the next team meeting, address how the others can step-up, and how that person should take a step-down. 
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I could handle it, but we're a team, and we can all contribute for facilitation. Which we can discuss initial expectations.
