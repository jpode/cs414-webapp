        <p>Hello! My name is Drew Boston, and I write computer programs. I'm currently a student at Colorado State University. I am fascinated by machine learning and artificial intelligence, and will likely pursue a career involving either (or both) of these fields. Currently, I am able to explore both through my work with PARRIC, as detailed below under experience. </p>
