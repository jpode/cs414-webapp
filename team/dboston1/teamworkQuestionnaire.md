What is your personality type?
ISFP

Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?
Texting for sure, relatively available all hours but can be iffy on weekends due to work (12-14 hour days).

What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
I think we will learn a ton about working in a group setting; how to be effective at communicating, keeping up-to-date with changes and improvements, etc.

What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?
As I'm usually more of a solo-programmer, I'm excited to learn effective ways to work together in a group setting.

What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?
I imagine for everyone school and work schedules will be difficult to work around - but it will be great experience. 

What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?
I can understand both views; I think communicating expectations will be important.

Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?
I think so. As long as everyone is still contributing in general, pushing a little more for an A should be fine and benefit everyone.

How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?
Hard to say with programming - too many variables! :) But I imagine no more than 10 hours per week.

How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
Communication - people generally have preferences; if not, easy enough to simply pick tasks.

What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?
Hopefully they would have been letting the rest of the group know way ahead of time so we can figure something out. I think as long as we are consistent on github this should be easily avoidable / recognizable.

What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?
If it has a big enough impact, it would likely end up being something to discuss and work on as a group.

How will you deal with different work habits of team members?
As long as they can still get the work done, it's fine with me! My work habits aren't always the best due to work either, but I usually try to make up for it by starting very early.

Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
Sure! I think once a week (or so) would probably be a very good idea - even if just after class for a few minutes.

How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
Would depend on the assignment and issues we are running into, as well as how interrelated the individual aspects of our projects are.

Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?
I could go either way. I imagine if it is a large enough change that isn't a bad idea.

What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?
Figure out why they don't agree, and discuss whether another option works for everyone.

What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?
Talk to the group, try to make sure we all have relatively even responsibilities.

What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?
Again, talk to the group and see if they feel the same way, and what we could do about it going forward.
