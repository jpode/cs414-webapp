# Sprint 3 - *t09* - *OVER NINE THOUSAND!?*

## Goal

### A mobile, responsive map and itinerary!
### Shorter trips, and more places to go!
### Cleaner Code, with improved Coverage!
### Allow reverse order!

### Sprint Leader: *Jacob Servaty*

## Definition of Done

* Web application deployed on the production server (kiwis.cs.colostate.edu:31409)
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint.md).
* Product Increment release `v3.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the Release Notes template, and the arhived files.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>3.0.0</version>`.
* Javadoc and unit tests for public methods.
* Coverage at least 50% overall and for each class.

## Policies

* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests pull requests for master branch always.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

## Plan

Epics planned for this release.

* *#139 Clean Code*
* *#140 Code Coverage*
* *#141 Build a trip from existing information*
* *#142 Design a trip from scratch/manually*
* *#159 Give the user an option to view a shorter trip*
* *#162 Let the user reverse the order of the trip*

In Sprint2 we began with around 38/39 initial tasks to complete, and we've started with a similar amount for Sprint3. If our velocity stays the same, then we should keep our predictable pace.
