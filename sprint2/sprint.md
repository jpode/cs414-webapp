## Retrospective

Topic | Teamwork | Process | Tools
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
What we will change this time | We could possibly communicate more consistently. | Give better estimations of work load for issues. | Use Intellij fully and use Zenhub to when considering pull requests.
What we did well | We helped pick up the slack when one team member was too busy | Used Zenhub to understand how much is left to do and what is finished. | Figured out the server and understand Intellij in order to deploy and test our server
What we need to work on | Working on the efficency of our SCRUM meetings | Spread out our work over the entire sprint to leave more time for testing. | Figruing out the new tools for the sprint earlier.
What we will change next time | Work on cleaner and more readable code. | More consistently and efficently do SCRUMS | Test using Intellij more often.
